# Exercise 2 #

In this exercise you'll create a simple C# application. The application is used for logging information about types you create.
As you progress through the steps, feel free to add comments to the code about *why* you choose to do things a certain way. Add comments if you felt like there's a better, but more time intensive way to implement specific functionality. It's OK to be more verbose in your comments than typical, to give us a better idea of your thoughts when writing the code.

### What you need ###

* IDE of your choice
* Git

## Instructions ##

This test is broken into multiple phases. You can implement one phase at a time or all phases at once, whatever you find to be best for you.

### Phase 1 ###

**Project setup**:

 1. Create a new C# Console Project inside this directory, put "Virbela" and your name in the project name.
 1. Add two classes named "Logger" and "DeliveryRobot".
     1. If you deem necessary, feel free to add any additional C# types you require to meet the functional goals.

**Functional Goal 1**:

 1. Code the DeliveryRobot to have a Name, Purpose and Destination.
 1. Code the Logger to accept a DeliveryRobot and print its data to the console.

### Phase 2 ###

**Functional Goal 2**:

 1. Add two classes named "ToastRobot" and "ButterRobot".
 1. Code the ToastRobot and ButterRobot to have a Name and Purpose.
 1. Ensure the ToastRobot can track how many pieces of bread it's toasting.
 1. Ensure the ButterRobot can track how much butter it has in its butter hopper.
 1. Ensure the Logger is able to print the values for both a ToastRobot and a ButterRobot (and DeliveryRobot).

### Phase 3 ###

**Functional Goal 3**:

1. Add a class named "VonNeumannRobot".
1. Code the VonNeumannRobot to have a Name and Purpose.
1. Code the VonNeumannRobot to accept any robot object and return a copy, with all the same values as the original, except the Name has been modified in some way to make it unique.
1. Ensure the Logger class is able to print the values for all robots, including the VonNeumannRobot.

## Questions ##

 1. How much time did you spend on your implementation?
 1. What was most challenging for you?
 1. What else would you add to this exercise?

## Optional ##

* Make use of dependency injection when implementing the functional goals. Feel free to use an existing framework or create your own.
* Add Unit Tests
* Add XML docs
* Have the logger also write to a file
* Have the logger read robot data from a file and output it to the console

## Next Steps ##

* Confirm you've addressed the functional goals
* Answer the questions above by adding them to this file
* Commit and push the entire repository, with your completed project, back into a repository host of your choice (bitbucket, github, gitlab, etc.)
* Share your project URL with your Virbela contact (Recruiter or Hiring Manager)
